  <description>V1.1 COMPATIBLE!
    Adds an advanced hydroponics basin that automatically sows and harvests its crop. Requires 90 steel, 10 plasteel, and 2 advanced components to construct. Consumes 140 watts when powered. Fertility and light requirement is identical to that of a standard hydroponics basin.\n\nNote that if the desired crop is changed, it must be manually cut. Otherwise, the basin will wait until the current crop is auto-harvested to begin producing the new crop.
